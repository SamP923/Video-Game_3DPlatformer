# 3D Platformer
 A 3D platformer where the player tries to collect coins and jump on platforms to reach an endpoint. Made with Unity for Game Design 2019.<br><br>

### Gameplay
The player is the yellow smiley-face cube, who is able to jump up to the wooden platforms. Once the player is is in contact with the coins, the coin prefabs disappear and add 1 to the users score. The objective is to reach the blue sphere, which will take the player to the next level. The game currently loops through the three levels until the player loses all three lives. If the player touches the blue-black enemy cubes, they lose a life. If the player falls off of the map, they also lose a life. If the player loses all three lives, the game ends.

### How to Play
You can download and play the game by downloading the zip file <code>3DPlatformer.zip</code>. Extract the files to a folder. The <code>3DIntroProject_Data</code> folder and the <code>3DIntroProject.exe</code> need to be in the same folder in order to run. Run the executable.

### Expansions
In the future, I would like to expand this project to make a full-fleshed game.
1. Add more levels with a progression (and increased difficulty), instead of looping through the three current ones.
2. Create a level-picker from the home menu.
3. Create a background or depth for when the player falls off of the main platform.
4. Add a screen that explains movement and controls (and also make the exploitation of the movement system more obvious)
5. Add a storyline for the cube adventurer
6. Allow the user to control the view of the camera using the mouse
